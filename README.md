## Deploys BIG-IP in AWS Cloud

This Terraform module deploys N-nic F5 BIG-IP in AWS cloud,and with module count feature we can also deploy multiple instances of BIG-IP.

## Prerequisites

This module is supported from Terraform 0.13 version onwards.

Below templates are tested and worked in the following version 

Terraform v0.13.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm v2.28.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v2.1.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v2.3.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.1.2


## Example Usage

We have provided some common deployment [examples](https://github.com/f5devcentral/terraform-aws-bigip-module/tree/master/examples)

below example snippet show how this module called.

```

#
#Example 1-NIC Deployment Module usage
#
module bigip {
  source                 = "../../"
  prefix                 = "bigip-aws-1nic"
  ec2_key_name           = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids        = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true }]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
}

#
#Example 2-NIC Deployment Module usage
#
module bigip {
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-aws-2nic"
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true }]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
}

#
#Example 3-NIC Deployment  Module usage
#
module bigip {
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-aws-3nic"
  ec2_key_name                = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt", "public_ip" = true }]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{ "subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false }]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
}

```

#### Required Input Variables
